# hello-world
Creating my first repository! 
I'm excited to be party of this developing industry. My goal for myself is one day to be a good developer. What I mean about a good developer is someone who is able to 'merge' their passions in life with their technical skills. Developing is simply a method to achieve ones goals. Lets work hard, work efficiently, use teamwork, and make the world a better place with each line of code you write. Mhmm wouldn't it be awesome if every developer has to take our own version of hippocratic oath?
